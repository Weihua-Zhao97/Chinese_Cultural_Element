Chinese Cultural Elements is an original R project collection that produces animated digital art celebrating traditional Chinese culture. Traditional iconography is encoded into numerical matrices and geometric coordinates to endow culturally significant figures and symbols with digital life, while every pixel, vector and animation frame is defined by reproducible code, merging computational creativity with cultural heritage.

### The Chinese God of Wealth
This work transformed a 29-by-25 matrix into a discrete heatmap using R, with a customized color scale featuring purple for luck and green for harmony. The plot gives a pixel-art representation of the Chinese god of wealth, sending data-driven wishes for 2026. An animated GIF was also created to visualize the drawing process line by line.

- **Data:** A customized 29×25 matrix
- **Tool:** @R `ggplot2` | `gganimate` (for frame-by-frame animation)

### 2026 Year of the Fire Horse
This work visualized a walking horse animation in Hermès style using R. With custom coordinate data and geometric rotation algorithms, the horse's delicate silhouette (including body, mane and saddle) is defined mathematically and animated with leg movement. The horse's color gradually shifts to a vibrant fiery red, accompanied by simulated flickering fire particles—all fully generated through code without any imported images or external assets.
